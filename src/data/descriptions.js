    morningGapScan: "The Morning Gap Strategy  takes advantage of inefficiencies in the way the price of an equity is calculated at market open. This scan checks if there is a gap between 2% and 10% from the previous market close to the market open.",
    rsiScan: "The RSI Strategy is used to signal when an equity is overbought or oversold.",
    momentumGapScan: "The Momentum Gap Strategy is used to indicate a potential trend change. When at a breakout point a gap indicates the start of a strong trend. When it occurs in the middle of a trend it is a strong sign of a reversal. The strategy requires a gap between any two candles that has significantly more volume and is a gap that is greater than 8%.",
    aboveMovingAverageScan: "The Above Moving Average Strategy if the price is above the moving average and how many bars ago the price crossed over the moving average. This helps indicate whether or not the equity is in an upward trend.",

If green, there was a gap up and a short position should be taken. If false then a morning gap did not occur",

If a moving average is applicable then it returns the number of ticks the small moving average has been above the large moving average and a long position is recommended.",
